"""
Insert data into HBase with a Python script.
To create the table, first use the hbase shell. We are going to create a
namespace called "sample_data". The table for this script is called "rfic",
as we will be inserting Request for Information Cases from the City of
Indianapolis.
Our table will have only one column family named "data", and we are accepting
all table defaults.
